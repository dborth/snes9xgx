Here's some basic instructions on compiling SNES9x GX. You don't need to be a programmer to follow these instructions but you should have some basic computer know-how. There's a few reasons you might want to do this:

 # To use the latest version of the emulator (note that beta versions may be unstable)
 # To access roms/saves from Windows File Sharing (SMB), without needing an SD card - just edit s9xconfig.cpp
 # To make your own custom changes

= Instructions =

 # Download and install [http://www.devkitpro.org devkitPPC r18], and be sure to install all of the optional libraries (FreeType, Mini-XML, libpng, tremor).
 # Download the source from [http://code.google.com/p/snes9x-gx/source/checkout SVN].
 # Run Programmer's Notepad (installed with devkitPro)
 # Find the Makefile from the source you downloaded. Click Tools > Make.
 # You're done!
