The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the [http://hbc.hackmii.com/ Homebrew Channel]. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the snes9xgx directory structure required (a sample structure is included in the archive).

For more detailed instructions, see [http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Snes9x_GX Wiibrew].

== GameCube == 

You can load Snes9x GX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by making a bootable DVD.
